Problem 1:
Pixel - a pixel is the smallest thing displayed on a computer, it has 3 values
red, green, blue and is a grid that work together to create all images
on a computer monitor.

Frame - a frame is one image in a set of images, for example, if your 
computer is 60hz it goes through 60 frames per second, the user
sees 60 different frames every second.

Aliasing/AntiAliasing - The aliasing is that serration you see on 
borders around 3d objects when they're being rendered,The 
antialiasing is a blur effect that smoothens those borders. 
In video games we see antialiasing with fencing a lot.

Resolution - resolution is the amount of pixels a specific monitor has
it is measured by height and width, most monitors today have
1920 by 1080 resolutions and we just call that 1080p resolution.
but if we multiply 1920 x 1080 that is how many pixels that are
making up the resolution of that monitor.

bitmap/pixelmap - a bitmap is a map that has 1 bit of information in each
value whereas a pixelmap has 2 or more bits of information in those values

bitdepth - is the number of colors a specific monitor can output.

Problem 2:
A vertex shader determines the shapes position
A fragment shader determines a shapes color

Problem 3:
line 1 and 15 are the opening and closing tags in html that tells the file
that the lines inbetween are javascript

line 3 is assigning the canvas tag to a variable in javascript via its ID

line 5 is making the canvas have webgl functionality

line 6-9 is error handling whether gl returns the webglcontext or not, 
console logs upon failure

line 11-14 does the same thing, more error handling to detemine whether the
shaders have been initialized or not.
