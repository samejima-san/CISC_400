on line 15  of HelloTriangle_FragCoord, this is the creation of the gradient. 
The gl_FragColor variable takes in a vector 4, with the combination of some clever math
and smart placement of each individual color you get a smooth color gradient across 
entire shape, this being a triangle.

The secret about the gradient is that it is actually spread across the entire canvas and 
not spread across the triangle itself, if we were to translate or scale the 
triangle in different ways the color of the gradient will come 
in different quantities. For example, if I were to translate the gradient 
on the x axis about .4, the triangle will appear a lot more red than when it 
is shown at x=0
