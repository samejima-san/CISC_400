when you stop clearing the canvas on line 64 the background goes away
this happens because you redraw the canvas with everything added 
and the background has to be defined, and is defined black on clear.

the same issue occurs when we change the behavior on line 69, changing
it to only draw the new point rather than looping through the array of 
points. When we draw something new everything else is erased because
it needs to be redrawn and we no longer have that information.
